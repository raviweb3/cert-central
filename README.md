## The Problem

> ### Certified Skill set

1. Motiviation for Individuals to Perform Better
   - Every effort can be recognised in the context. Every such recognization is a permanent record on blockchain.
2. Less Control over Data
   - Users have less control over their data, as these data are hosted and owned by these cloud providers. As long as the control of your data lies in the hands of those whose sole motivation is to make profits, you will always have less control over your data.
3. Mismanagement of Data
   - There are many cases where centralised storage providers fail to manage user data, making data that is supposed to be private - public
4. Not Sustainble for Data to "Live Forever"
   - Last but not least, the main takeaway is that it is not sustainable for data to live forever on centralised storages.

So how do we solve the issue with centralised storage?
